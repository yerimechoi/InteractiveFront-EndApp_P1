# Project 1 - eVie

## Description
This project was to use 2 server-side APIs to create a real-world front-end application. eVie is a web application to locate electric vehicle charging stations near the user and get more details on what the charging stations offers.

## User Story
AS A driver
I WANT to find EV charging stations
SO I can charge my vehicle

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am an electric vehicle driver looking for charging stations,
WHEN I open the app
THEN I will be directed to a landing page
WHEN I search a location on the app,
THEN I will be taken to that area on the map and  shown charging stations within the area                     
WHEN I select a charging station
THEN I will be shown information about that charging station

## Mock-Up vs. Project
The following shows the comparison between the mock-up and the final site. The mock-up was created in figma as a wireframe as to how the site will look and act. Following the wireframe, the site looks very similar to the mock-up with additional details and animations.
